# PPMA Code (adapted from OmniMAE)

We adapt the code base from the [OmniMAE repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/omnivore).

We implement the two-stage action recognition pretraining method: Privacy-Preserving MAE Align method. 
This code base trains and evaluates on the benchmark we propose.

Refer to <a href="omnivision/">omnivision/</a> for instructions on running the code base.
